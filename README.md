## What is a Pi-hole?
Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker.
I will install and set up a Pi-hole on Raspberry Pi to block advertisements on all devices connected to my home network.

## How does the Pi-hole work?
Pi-hole functions as an internal, private DNS server for my home network.
Usually the DNS server is running on the router. So, I will install Pi-hole on the Raspberry Pi and sets the Raspberry Pi to be the DNS for my home network.
Pi-hole will intercept any queries for known ad-serving domains and deny them access, so ads wonâ€™t be downloaded.

## Project Prerequisites:
- Raspberry Pi Zero W with Raspbian Lite image installed on it.
